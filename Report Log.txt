First I thought that we needed to figure out how the encryption works

Then I readying key line in instruction, i realized that we can use crypt to encrypt out brute force combos and then all we need is compare encrypted result
Then I thought that I needed to use FILE but when looking at provided code, functions already have parameters
Inside the function 1:
	Primer paso, pasa la sal
    
Next step was to create an array with all the alphabet, to make it easier i only used integers
Then my plan was to have four bytes, one representing the each "digit" and that would match to the index of alphatet meaning a character
After failing i then opted for following Harrisons advice and instead popullate at least the 2 digit combos
Once this was done i had to come up witha way to do eitehr 3 vs 4 character long
then figuring out how to properly compare stirngs


***TIPS***
COmbinations first aaa, aab, aac, it will work in an hour
to pass speedy you can use all cores, or singlethread but use special combinatorics algorithm

wanted to use pthread but instead now using fork()
went back to pthread because processes finish before the other ending the test
extensive issues implementing pthreads

pthreads work but now join is problem
joining succesful use of join, but strcmp not working (issue could be crypt not thread safe)
after extensive test and using semaphores nothing worked, only thing that worked was using crypt_r, problem solved**
