First I thought that we needed to figure out how the encryption works

Then I readying key line in instruction, i realized that we can use crypt to encrypt out briute force combos annd then all we need is compare encrypted result
Then I tought that I needed to use FILE but when looking at provided code, functions already have parameters
Inside the fucntion 1:
	Primer paso, pasa la sal
    
Next step was to create an array with all the alphabet, to make it easier i only used integers
Then my plan was to have four bytes, one representing the each "digit" and thatw oukld match to the index of alphatet meaning a character
Afetr failling i then opted for following Harrisons advice and instead oppullate at leat the 2 digit combos
Once this was done i had to come up witha way to do eitehr 3 vs 4 character long
then figuring out how to properly compare stirngs


***TIPS***
COmbinations first aaa, aab, aac, it will work in an hour
to pass speedy you can use all cores, or singlethread but use special combinbatronics algorithm

wanted to use pthread but instead now using fork()
went back to pthrea dbecause processes finish before the otehr ending the test
extensive issue implementhing threads
